# Quouch's Flutter App

Quouch's brand new Flutter app, built with the help of the Flutter SDK and the Dart programming language.
This app is a work in progress and will be updated as time goes on.

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, you will need to have the Flutter SDK installed on your machine. You can find the
installation instructions [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

Once you have the Flutter SDK installed, you can clone this repository and run the app on your machine. To do this, run
the following commands:

```bash
git clone
cd quouch_flutter
flutter run
```

This will run the app on your machine, and you will be able to see the app in action.
